Autumn is often associated with certain decorations, including cornucopias, garlands, straw or grapevine wreaths, and dried flower arrangements.  Although many decorations can be bought ready-made, making your own can be a fun family activity for a fall afternoon. 

For the cornucopia, which signifies a bountiful harvest with plenty to eat, you'll need the traditional horn-shaped basket (available at most craft or basket shops); shellac or paint; real, dried, or artificial fruit and vegetables; pine cones; and plant materials.  Paint or shellac the basket before you begin, allowing plenty of time to dry, before you fill with your choice of items. Be creative! 


Another decoration appropriate for the fall season is a straw or grapevine wreath.  Hop vines work great, too!  Again, supplies are available at craft shops.  Wrap the wreath with colorful ribbon, covering the entire surface, or loosely wrap it, leaving sections exposed.  Then add the finishing touches--a colorful bow, a few sprigs of wheat, or a cluster of fruit.
