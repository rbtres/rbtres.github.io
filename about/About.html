			<br />
I am a student at Champlain College pursuing a degree in Game Programming. I became a game programmer because of my love of math, logic, video games and programming.<br />
<br />
I have worked in many teams and learned many skills, that I am looking forward to apply in a workplace environment. I am a quick learner and always excited to try new things. I am a dedicated worker who works well on teams of various sizes.<br />
<br />
I have a passion for programming that I am excited to continue to explore. I enjoy facing challenging problems and solving them. I love thinking of ways to implement features and then having my ideas come to life as I program them.
